# haiku-generator
The Haiku Generator is fed a series of pre-existing poems, and uses Markov chains to generate a large number of sentences from those poems. The text generated is then fed through a series of tests to determine which sequence of words are added to the final haiku. 

To start generating haikus, run HaikuMain.java

Note: Run FileAdjustments.java if changes to the poem.txt file are made (or if you create your own list of poems to generate the haikus from). Make sure to add specific file names in the main method.
